SUMMARY
We have started with cleaning the data set and exploring the data set. Next we go on to the model building phase where we first
create a rating matrix and then creating a evaluation scheme and model validation and setting up a list of algorithms we wanted to
evaluate. Training the model and visualizing the results. According to the ROC curve, item based Cf is the best trained one.The
precision recall plot confirms that item-based Collaborative Filter (IBCF) is the best model because it has higher Recall for any
given level of Precision. Then at last we make predictions.
